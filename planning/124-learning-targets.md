# MTH 124 Learning Targets 

**7/5: First pass gives 29 learning targets. Can I cut/combine to get 25?** 

Notes: 
- In any Learning Target involving a function, you need to be ready to do the task using any of the **four representations** of a function unless the target states otherwise. These four representations are *numerical* (a table of data), *graphical* (a graph of the function), *verbal* (a word description), and *symbolic* (an equation of the function). 
- Learning Target problems will always ask not only for a right answer but also complete and correct explanations of your reasoning. 

## Group F: Functions (12)

- F.1: I can identify the independent and dependent variables in a relationship and determine if that relationship is a function.
- F.2: I can determine the domain, range, and codomain of a function.
- F.3: I can use function notation to find and simplify the output of a function given an input, and find an input that produces a given output. 
- F.4: I can find the average rate of change in a function on a given interval and state the units of the average rate of change. 
- F.5 (**CORE**): I can determine whether a function is linear or not; and if it is linear, I can find its slope. 
- F.6: Given two points on the graph of a linear function, or one point and the slope, I can find an equation for the function in point-slope and slope-intercept form and interpret the practical meaning of the slope and intercepts. 
- F.7: I can find the zeroes, vertex, and axis of symmetry of a quadratic function. 
- F.8: Given a function in numerical or graphical format, I can determine the intervals where the function is increasing/decreasing and the intervals where the function is concave up/concave down. 
- F.9: I can compute values of the composition of two functions; if the functions are given symbolically, I can determine an equation for their composite. 
- F.10: I can determine whether a function has an inverse and find values of the inverse given input-output pairs of the original. 
- F.11: I can describe the graphical effect of a transformation of a function and find the formula for a function given a parent function and a set of transformations.
- F.12: I can find values of the sum, difference, product, and quotient of two functions.


## Group C: Circular Functions (5)

- C.1: I can find the midline, amplitude, and period of a circular function given either a graph or information about the circle that creates it.
- C.2: I can convert between radian and degree measures of an angle and determine the reference angle for a large angle value.
- C.3: I can state the sine and cosine values of the 16 special angles on the unit circle.
- C.4: I can state and apply properties of the sine and cosine functions and the Fundamental Trigonometric Identity. 
- C.5: I can find the amplitude, period, and midline of a transformed version of the basic sine or cosine function; and I can find the formulas for transformed versions of the basic sine or cosine function.

## Group EL: Exponential and Logarithmic Functions (5) 

- EL.1: Given the formula for an exponential function, I can determine the growth rate and growth factor; determine the domain, range, and $y$-intercept of the function; and state whether the function is increasing, decreasing, concave up, or concave down.
- EL.2: I can find the formula for an exponential function given two data points for the function.
- EL.3: I can describe the long-term behavior of an exponential function or a transformed version of an exponential function.
- EL.4 (**CORE**): I can state the basic properties of the logarithm base 10 and the natural logarithm, and apply these to compute exact values of simple logarithms and to solve equations. 
- EL.5 (**CORE**): I can state the properties for logarithms of products, quotients, and exponential expressions and apply these to solving equations. 

## Group T: Trigonometry (4)

- T.1: Given partial information about a right triangle, I can determine as many of the remaining side and angle values as possible. 
- T.2: I can find the values of sine, cosine, and tangent for angles in a right triangle with labelled sides.
- T.3: I can compute the values of the arcsine, arccosine, and arctangent functions for inputs arising from the unit circle or a labelled right triangle.
- T.4: I can find the values of the tangent, secant, cosecant, and cotangent functions at special points on the unit circle or given angles in a right triangle with labelled sides.

## Group PR: Polynomial and Rational Functions (3) 

- P.1: I can find the limit of a function as the input increases or decreases without bound (or determine that the limit fails to exist).
- P.2: I can identify the degree, coefficients, constant and linear terms, and leading coefficient of a polynomial; and given a graph of a polynomial, I can identify its zeroes, the multiplicity of zeroes, and turning points. 
- P.3: I can determine the long-term behavior, domain, zeroes, and holes of a rational function.
