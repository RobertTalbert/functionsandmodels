# MTH 124 Brainstorming on class activities 

+ Need to determine a time in class for assessments 
  + M 4-5, TR 4-6. 
  + How did Matt do this?  
  + Leaning toward Mondays -- complete what you can in class, turn in the rest later but only completions of what you started in class (?)
+ The usual suspects:
  + Desmos activities, done in pairs/threes/fours 
    + Card sorts
    + Polygraphs? https://blog.desmos.com/articles/polygraph/ 
  + End of class -- exit tickets to complete
    + Questions
    + Things they learned
    + What worked/what blocked 
+ STATIONS
  + Students self-select into stations, that contain worksheets to complete 
  + Including:
    + Algebra practice 
    + Applications 
    + More or less --- current learning objectives, basic objectives, previous objectives --- sort yourselves, and come and go as needed 
  + Will this really work with only 8 students? 
+ Beginning of class
  + Students do preclass work which consists of exercises --- 0/1 points on basis of completeness and effort. 
  + Students get together at beginning of class to do pair quiz, randomly selected pairs, redo some subset of the exercises and hand in, also 0/1 on basis of correctness. 
  + Follow pair quizzing up with clickers and debrief (maybe)
  + Neither of these happen on assessment days. 
  + Counting 28 TR class meetings. Make the max out of 50 so it allows a lot of "drops".
