# Assessments for MTH 124

## Second pass 

- Pre-class activities with pair quizzing 
- Learning Targets assessed through quizzes 
  - Levels: 0, 1, and 2 
  - 0: No evidence yet of fluency 
  - 1: Student has given acceptable demo of fluency once 
  - 2: Student has given acceptable demo of fluency twice 
  - Ways to demo: 
    - LT Quizzes (Mondays?)
    - Make a video 
    - Oral exam in office hours 
- Explorations (miniprojects, etc.)
  - Involve modeling, writing, explanation plus math background 
  - Don't give free choice on these; make them more like biweekly challenges 
- Final exam 
  - All Core LTs
  - Plus big picture items 
  - Use these for points to give +/- adjustment, and one final attempt at core 
  - Let students choose any LT to add on 
- Startup modules 
  - Onboarding
  - Tech training 
- Engagement 
  - Practice on WeBWorK (1 successfully completed problem = 1 point) 
  - Surveys (1 survey = 1 point) 
  - Randomly given points
