# Functions and Models

This repository contains materials for MTH 124: Functions and Models, taught at [Grand Valley State University](http://www.gvsu.edu). The catalog entry for the course reads:

>Study of preparatory material for calculus using symbolic algebra and trigonometry for solving equations, representing functions, and modeling, plus appropriate technology. Core topics: concept of function, average rate of change of a function, inverse and composite functions, trigonometric functions, exponential and logarithmic functions, and right triangle trigonometry. Fulfills Foundations - Mathematical Sciences. Offered fall and winter semesters. Prerequisite: MTH 110.

* The `planning` folder contains documents and notes for the design of the course. 
* Other folders are present for the specific materials for a given semester. Right now, there is only one semester represented, Fall 2021. Other semesters will be added as separate folders in the future. 
* For specific materials like syllabi and assessents, pick a semester and then look for the materials. 

The textbook we use is [Active Prelude to Calculus](https://activecalculus.org/prelude/book-1.html) by Matt Boelkins.
